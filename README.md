#Travel Website Project
###By Drew Devlin and David Quisenberry
##Description
This project was an exercise in git branching merging.  We created a master branch with the basic information for a sample hotel website.  We then created separate branches for a variety of user experience using css style sheets.  Adventure won out and is now in the master branch before you.
